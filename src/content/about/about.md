My system, which benefits you, is called True Astrology™, it is a combination of Western and Vedic Astrology. the problem with Western Astrology is the signs are 24 degrees fast-forwarded. Likewise, Vedic Astrology stops at Saturn, it doesn’t cover Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto.

Even with Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, a Natal chart won’t make sense, there are 3 additional planets I use called Planet X (Mithras), Planet Y (Hephaestus), and Planet Z (Lucifer), which are extremely powerful in determining your life path. I am an highly intuitive Astrologer with very precise readings.

My teacher in Astrology was Greenstone Lobo, and he was taught by Linda Goodman. I’m familiar with Western, Vedic, and Chaldean systems, and you will also get the benefit of Hellenistic Astrology which I use in my practice.
