Jesus Ascendant, or the 1st House in Astrology, is in Sagittarius. there are several reasons why. the first is Sagittarius represents a teacher. the personality is not as important as the Ascendant, which determines the house placements.

the house placements determines one's social or life role as well as the placements of All the other planet's in one's birth chart.

In a Sagittarius Ascendant, the 9th house, which relates to travels, teaching, healing, and entertaining will always be Leo, which gives a Sagittarius Ascendant a very strong 9th house and if there are any planets there, or planetary Lordships (dominions) placed in other houses that are the ruler of the 9th house, specifically the Planet Z*,

Which I am the first person in the world to call, Iosys (or Jesus in Greek). then it is fitting that the Planet Z would be the Lord of the 9th house for a Sagittarius Ascendant (whom Jesus was born on).

Io represents the Moon, and Sys means 'to regulate,' like system. Jesus, Son of Joseph, Joseph means 'Moon' in Hebrew, Joseph is of the Tribe of Judah (Yehudah). Jesus' Moon was in Leo.

Io is directly related to Isis, (Selene in Greek), and represents the High Priestess. Jesus does represent the High Priestess as a Priest, or a Great teacher, beyond that of a priest.

Yesod means 9 in the Kabbalah, Jesus' 9th House will be in Leo if his Ascendant is in Sagittarius, the teacher.

the 9th Tarot Key is the Hermit, also known as a Sage or the one that guides others with his lantern.

Jesus, which is you, maybe a more developed version of you from now, is the True Cosmic Administrator.

* = Planet Z is is an Centaur-class Asteroid classified as 2008 FC76 according to NASA. Sagittarius is a Centaur.

If I have access to Astrology software, I can pinpoint Jesus exact birthday, birth time, and birth place.

If you have a Sagittarius Ascendant, your 10th house, or your Midheaven, which means life purpose, will always be in Virgo, which means service to others, self-sacrifice, and also diligence in carrying out that role.

people with Sagittarius Ascendants can be great teachers, entertainers, DJs, doctors, musicians, and because of Sagittarius' nature, they will always travel to teach or play music to crowds.

Jesus had special healing abilities and was able to heal other people and raise people from the death by simply intoning Talitha koum! (Mark 5:41).

5 + 41 is 10 because 5 + 4 + 1 is 10. 10 represents the Star, Regulus, to regulate, and is connected to Leo. Mark means Leo if you didn't know that. So the passage could mean 'Lion of Lions,' or 'King of Kings' when Jesus resurrects Jairus' daughter.

https://biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%205%3A21-43&version=NIV

Jairus, who was a very high-ranking rabbi, means 'God enlightens,' or God takes the burden off his shoulder, when Jesus healed his daughter. enlightenment doesn't necessarily mean some kind of spiritual attainment, which is more Gnostic, but "to make lighter," to become pure.

there is One More reason why Jesus' Ascendant is in Sagittarius and this relates to Astronomy.

Scorpio, which is my Zodiac sign in Vedic, is the only Zodiac sign that does not appear in the 'Northern Hemisphere.' You can see every other Zodiac sign, for a total of 11, which relates to Libra, or Justice.

there's no 12th Zodiac sign (unless you cheat).

that's interesting because Scorpio represents the Underworld, or Hades in Greek mythology, and when Jesus is born on April 14th, on the day Orthodox Christians celebrate Easter, Jesus arises from the Underworld.

Get it?

the transition from Scorpio to Sagittarius represents a resurrection. Jesus mentally was a Sagittarius in esoteric works (we won't get into this for the time being),

but Sagittarius being the first sign of the Zodiac corresponds to Alchemy, (Arabic al-khemia), which is root word for the word Chokmah, which means Wisdom.

Moreover, Jesus' Imum coeli, or descendant in Astrology, is in Taurus, which means Jesus can't die.

Taurus means 'the Undying Sun.' 6th house in Astrology means the body. that means he can't physically or spiritually die, (just like Sun Wukong when Erlang or Sirius, embodying the Dog Star, or Satan, tries to kill him).

Washington D.C. is aligned to Sirius by the founding fathers, so it should tell you what their intentions are.

What's fascinating about Sirius is that it is not observable in the Northern Hemisphere and is in the Southern Hemisphere in Canis Major, which represents the Underworld, as Cerberus. (hmm founding fathers...)

I love you, and

I hereby pray for those who are suffering, whose hearts are heavy, as well as those who have lost their lives recently,

Bless those who mourn, eternal God, with the comfort of your love that they may face each new day with hope and the certainty that nothing can destroy the good that has been given. May their memories become joyful, their days enriched with friendship, and their lives encircled by your love.

Amen âˆ´
