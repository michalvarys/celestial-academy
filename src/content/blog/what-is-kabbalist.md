A Kabbalist is someone who follows the Oral Law (Malkuth) as well as the Written Law, the Torah. Kabbalists reject entirely the idea of a creator micromanaging our daily affairs a God (Yahweh) that administers rewards and punishments, but rather that Actions have consequences.

Negative Actions have negative consequences. If someone does something bad, it usually has negative consequences.

Yahweh is a Gnostic creation that assigns blame towards God in theodicy, which means theological challenges associated with an All-powerful God.

the true name of God is Yehovah, יְהֹוָה as well as myriad of Names of Gods; All of them represent our concepts of God, but don't represent God as a Whole, because God is beyond Understanding and enrobed Wisdom.

Yehovah is pronounced יְ Yod with a Sheva , הֹ Hei with a Cholom, and Vah וָה - this sounds like either Ye ho 'vah or 'Ye ho vah. either is Ok because 'Ye ho vah would stress the masculine, while Ye ho 'vah, which sounds more Hebrew, would accent the feminine.

What's funny about the name יְהֹוָה is it first appears in Exodus 3:13–15, which reduces to 7, 3:14 would be 8, eternal life, eheiyeh אהיה, and 3:15 would be 9.

Six (Metatron, the Serpent) was afraid of 7 because 7 8 9.
