I did a reading for William Shakespeare.

Mr. Shakespeare has extremely good teaching skills and it is known that he translated (from Hebrew and Greek) and wrote the King James Version of the Bible. Pluto exalted in 25 degree exaltation rules that which is hidden. X also in 3rd exaltation near 25.

Neptune in 12th makes him very interested in Spirituality, Lord of Career (he Authored that translation).

I see a 6th - 9th connection too. Rahu is in 7th makes him attached to the public domain. Venus has red circle because it's in 12th. [this is most important because it relates to the Secret Word of John, in John 1:1].

9th House means the Law and the Bible means 'The Law' in Hebrew. Having Pluto and X, two of the most powerful Planets in Aquarius in 25 degree exaltation makes the native a fitting translator and editor for one of the most influential and powerful books ever written.  therefore, the 9th House in Astrology has a secret correlation. the 9th House connects to Language, or the Word.

Current Transits:

Currently, Mr. Shakespeare has X in Gemini, meaning that his works are experiencing a newfound surge of interest, especially with the emergence of online tools and apps to read the Bible. this will be expected to last until 2037.

Pluto, Lord of 8th House, currently in Capricorn as of 2024, gives him fame and controversy on his origins, and this transit will last until 2037.
