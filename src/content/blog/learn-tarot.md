I'm offering a class on discord which teaches you how to use Archetypes within the Tarot to improve your lives. We will explore concepts deeply embedded in our psychology and use them toward advancing in your career, or coping with unmanageable stress.

this isn't a run-of-the mill course on how to do Tarot readings, which you can go to a psychic for that.

Instead, we will explore the deepest concepts in our imagination.

Many people suffer from stress in their lives, or loss, or frustration in their jobs, this course is designed to help you give direction and find the optimal balance in your life in which you can either mitigate or transform with the application of subconscious imagery.

My names is James and I am a teacher.

I am also one of the top Astrologers in the world (1000+ Astrology readings under my belt, which I have done for people including celebrities).

I am well versed in the Kabbalah (the actual text in the Zohar), and I know Hebrew.

What to expect from the course is,

We'll read course material together for 20 minutes, taking turns with other classmates, and then have a Q&A which I have prepared questions for another 20 minutes on how to apply these concepts to our lives, as an Course towards Practical Occultism.

You'll also get access to a community of people and feel secure knowing many people who have journeyed a similar path, towards healing the world, which needs a lot of healing.

My classes will start tomorrow, on April 24, 2024, at 5:30 PM Pacific, which is 7:30 PM Central, and 8:30 PM Eastern Standard Time, which I expect most students be from Eastern Time.

We will meet every 2 days, from April to June, which will be 46 lessons for a total of 31 hours.

I may consider switching it to 9:30 PM Eastern time or start on a later date depending on the enrollment to accommodate everyone.

Slots are limited, so Act now! the class will start tomorrow at 8:30 PM Eastern or when there is enough enrollment.

If you can't afford the lessons please message me. You still have to pay for the course but I will arrange something for you.

I've been teaching for about two years in the esoteric Tarot, which isn't the same thing as doing Tarot readings.

After you Master this course, you will have a basic understanding of the Major Arcana in Tarot in relationship towards using these concepts towards daily living.

then I will offer another course (Intermediary level) on Tarot Spreads and recognizing combinatorics / Magic Squares in July and August, and an Advanced course on how to do Tarot Readings, but that will be way far out in the future.

I'll steeply discount those future courses for you if you enroll now, which will cost way more in the future, if you have enrolled in 'Introduction to Practical Tarot.' which I offer at the value of $105, which is 31 hours of instruction.

Book Now, and we will work together towards applying concepts not known to the average person and healing the world so that our dreams come true.
