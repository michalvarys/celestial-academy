            My system, which benefits you, is called True Astrology™, it is a
            combination of Western and Vedic Astrology. the problem with Western
            Astrology is the signs are 24 degrees fast-forwarded. Likewise,
            Vedic Astrology stops at Saturn, it doesn’t cover Uranus, Neptune,
            and Pluto. <br /><br />Even with Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, a Natal
            chart won’t make sense, there are 3 additional planets I use called
            Planet X (Mithras), Planet Y (Hephaestus), and Planet Z (Lucifer),
            which are extremely powerful in determining your life path. I am an
            highly intuitive Astrologer with very precise readings.<br />
            <br />My teacher in Astrology was Greenstone Lobo, and he was taught
            by Linda Goodman. I’m familiar with Western, Vedic, and Chaldean
            systems, and you will also get the benefit of Hellenistic Astrology
            which I use in my practice.
